# Slot Machine

## Description
> This application allows the user to play a slot machine simulation game inside of their terminal by answering a series of prompts. I used node.js because it allows the user to run and interact with a program in their own terminal.  

## Installation
> To run this application you will need to have Node.js installed on your device. If packages and node modules aren't already present you'll need tp run "npm init" to install needed packages. Then you can run "npm i prompt-sync" to use the specific package that helps us display prompts in terminal.

## How To Use
>Once you are in the proper directory, type in the terminal: "node project.js". This will start the application. First you will be prompted to deposit a certain amount of money, however much you can spare! Then you can decide how many rows you would like to bet on, just like a real slot machine. Then specify how much money you would like to bet per row, and you've now pulled the slot! If you get three similar symbols across any row, you've won. Keep betting until you run out of money if you'd like, but you can quit anytime by responding with "n" when prompted to play again. Have fun and gamble responsibly!
